### Description
This project enables the user to take quick and easy notes while online. Additionally it guides the user through the installation process once they click the "install" button. Once it is installed the user can easily pull up the text editor while online and type any desired text off to the side. The greatest challenge I faced in the building of this project was getting the installer to work, as that had not been an aspect I had worked with previously. However, now that I have I can certainly see the benefits and uses of that functionality.

### Installation
The user will got to https://blooming-hamlet-55581.herokuapp.com/ and click "Install! in the upper lefthand corner of the web document. The system will then guide them through the installation process.

### Usage
This [video](https://youtu.be/IZaY2lvbivU) will demonstrate the usage of this project

### Credits
I had assistance from my tutor Corey Yates.

### Features
This project contains an installation package and in browser useability for text editing and note taking.

### Future Development
In the future it would be ideal to move from "just another text editor" to "Wow! This text editor stands out!" to where it can still be used to edit text while working in the browser, but has  functionaility similar to a more sophisticated word processor like Google Docs.
